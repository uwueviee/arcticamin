# Project: Arctic Amin

Getting Amin into the Arctic by 2/2/2020

## What is this project?

With GitHub's new [Arctic Code Vault](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzI9FNjXQ0o), all active public projects by 2/2/2020 will be put onto tape and then stored underground about 250 meters deep into the permafrost of an Arctic mountain.
We want Amin's face to be apart of those projects going in.

Every day until the 2nd of Feburary, 2020 one Amin picture will have to be uploaded to this repo, we hope that we are successful and we get Amin into the Arctic.

## Why Amin?

Why not.

## Criteria 

* Under 100kb
* SFW
* Still humanly viewable
* Some sort of image (Any image format works)

## How to contribute

First of all, thanks for helping! 

But you'll need a GitHub account if you already don't have one, you can make one [here](https://github.com/join).

After that, you'll want to "Fork" the project, this will create a duplicate where you can easily upload your images.
In order to do this, just click the "Fork" button in the top.

You'll then be redirected to another where it will look the same but your name will be in the top left, you will want to click the upload files button here.

You can then drag and drop your Amin pictures onto the page, we ask that you follow the naming scheme `amin_<your username>_image<number based on how many images you've uploaded>`.
After that, describe the image and then click "Commit changes".
